       HTML is basically like writing instructions for a web browser on how to display a website. For example, if you write HTML <U>background color</U> code specifying that your site should have a blue background, browsers read the code youve <img/>written and follow<input/> those instructions. The actual processes behind this are complicated and involve the transfer of data through the internet.If you’re interested in designing your own websites without using <b><i>templates, though,</i> </b> it’s not so important to understand the technical specifics of how websites are rendered in a browser. <p>It’s enough to know that HTML is an important part of this process, and that you need to have a good HTML structure in place if you want to build a functional, attractive website.</p>
